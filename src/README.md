# Benjamin Code Integration Challenger

This static page is a simple challenge proposed by Benjamin Code (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSx8tcGow88).
It allowed me to get back into the swing of things since I hadn't touched the web for several months.

## Tools
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Sass
- A little bit of Javascript ES6
- Webpack → images compression and hashed urls and babel for ES translation.
- PostCSS → autoprefixed rules.
